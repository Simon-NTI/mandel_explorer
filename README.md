# Mandel Explorer

Mandel Explorer is an application for plotting and rendering the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).  
Written in C, Mandel Explorer computes using double precision to swiftly plot the set at low magnification.
The resulting render is output as a bitmap into the current directory as either 24-bit color or 8-bit greyscale.

# Target Platforms

Mandel Explorer has been tested on both Windows and MacOS using GCC and Clang respectively.

# Usage

Input the parameters at the top and simply build + run the program.  
The rendered image will be spit out into the same folder that the program was ran.
